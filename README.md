you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

In the application we enter train time , destination , first train time , and frequency.then the application saves it in firebase database.
After we save our data , we display the information using one table in addtion to the next arrival time based on current time using moment
Js.
